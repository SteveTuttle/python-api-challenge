# python-api-challenge
UNC DataBootCamp API module challenge

## Challenge Descricription
### Background
> Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?

## Deliverables
This challenge is broken down into two parts, WeatherPY then VacationPY.
We will be working with Jupyter notebooks, using APIs from various sites to achieve this.
### Part-1: WeatherPY
Describe task notes
#### Requirement-1
