# python-api-challenge
UNC DataBootCamp API module challenge

## Challenge Descricription
### Background
> Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

> Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?

***from the UNC Bootcamp instructions for this challenge***

## Deliverables
This challenge is broken down into two parts, WeatherPY then VacationPY.
We will be working with Jupyter notebooks, using APIs from various sites to achieve this.
### Part-1: WeatherPY
Describe task notes
#### Requirement-1
Create charts:
* Latitude vs. Temperature

* Latitude vs. Humidity

* Latitude vs. Cloudiness

* Latitude vs. Wind Speed

#### Requirement-2
Create charts:
* Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude

* Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude

* Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude

* Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude

* Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude

* Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude

* Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

* Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

### Part-2: VacationPY
Describe task notes
Create Maps:
* Create a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame as shown in the following image. The size of the point should be the humidity in each city.

include png or links to png from readme to give examples
explain changes I made & why: color / metrics
